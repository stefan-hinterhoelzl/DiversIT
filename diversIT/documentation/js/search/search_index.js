(verwendeter Quelltext-Editor --> VS Code): a) Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) b) Angular CLI (in Commandline: npm install -g @angular/cli) c) Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) d) git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) --> (user.email und user.name konfigurieren!) d1) In Commandline: git config --global user.email \"...\" d2) In Commandline: git config --global user.name \"...\" Speziell (Nur beim Auftreten von Fehlermeldungen dass eine Komponente nicht installiert ist): e) Angular Devkit (in Commandline: npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular) f) Angular Compiler CLI (in Commandline: npm install --save-dev @angular/compiler-cli) g) Angular Compiler (in Commandline: npm install --save-dev @angular/compiler) Starten der Angular-Web-App (ACHTUNG: Darauf achten dass man im Terminal im richtigen Ordner ist): h) Node_Modules installieren --> npm install i) Webserver starten --> ng serve (Default-Host: http://localhost:4200)\nDokumentation\nHier kann die
