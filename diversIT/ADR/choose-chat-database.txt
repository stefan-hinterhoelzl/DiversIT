TITLE:
Choice of database for the chat implementation


STATUS:
Implemented


CONTEXT:
The chat implementation in the Firestore Database was producing too many write and read operations.
As per recommendation of the firebase documentation presence values like the "online" id on chats should be implemented with the realtime database.
The realtime database does not have any restrictions on read and write operations in the free plan.


DECISION:
The chat implementation is moved from the firestore database to the realtime database.


CONSEQUENCES:
The realtime database offers less querying and sorting/limiting power than the firestore database.
For this reason, sorting the chats and messages in descending order on the timestamp needs to be done on the client side.
The query is sorted ascending, the array is reversed on the client side.
This should not be a problem with O(n) time complexity on reversing the array. Additionally, the Chat has a shorter life span (Duration of Mentorship)
with less messages compared to chat applications like WhatsApp.
