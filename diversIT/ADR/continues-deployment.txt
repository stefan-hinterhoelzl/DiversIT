TITLE:
ADR008 - Choice of Continues Deployment


STATUS:
Accepted


CONTEXT:
As of now, the project does not have a continues Deployment. 
To this date, this was not necessary and provided no added benefit, as no tests were in place.
Now that a lot of tests are written, it does make sense, to automaticly test and forward changes from the github repository to the production website.


DECISION:
After comparing a lot of Continuous Deployment providers, we settled on GitHub Actions. 
The free contingent seems sufficient for this project and implementation does not take alot of time.
Furthermore, we decided to create a seperate branch, which starts the github Action. 
This allows the developers to keep working without any changes and if needed, 
a simple merge into the branch live-deployment fires of the github action and therefore, all the test, build and hosting steps. 


CONSEQUENCES:
The developers do not face any changes and have a very simple option to test and publish new changes. 
A simple push to live-deployment takes care of testing and deploying the code correctly. 
If a test fails, the website will not be published and all developers are notified via an email.
