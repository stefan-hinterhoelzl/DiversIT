TITLE:
ADR002 - Choice of Frontend Framework


STATUS:
Accepted


CONTEXT:
This project requires a backend to handle and store all data. On a high granularity, the first decision needs to be
wether the team aims for a PaaS or a self developed and hosted Backend, and the second desicion needs to face 
what exact technology will be used. 


DECISION:
The team decided on using Firebase.


CONSEQUENCES:
As the Team decided in ADR001 on using Angular, Firebase harmonizes very well with our frontend framework. Both are mainly 
developed by Google and therefore have a good interface to each other. Furthermore, Firebase also takes care of hosting the website. 
Saving our data on firestore and their real time database as well as the hosting itself is free for small scoped projects. 
Firebase functions which will be needed for some data manupilation does require to choose the blaze plan, but also has a free contingent.
All in all, Firebase does save alot of development time and provides a better uptime of the services than we could and all of this for free.
