TITLE:
ADR007 - How to register for DiversIT


STATUS:
Accepted


CONTEXT:
Clarification of the questions whether a login should be implemented by the team or whether the social login which Firebase offers should be used.
In addition, it should be clarified which authentication providers should be selected for the social login, if the social login is chosen.


DECISION:
It was decided to use the social login from Firebase, because a lot of programming work is omitted and the login works via many different providers. 
As login providers, three common providers (Google, Facebook and GitHub) were chosen, as the team believes that almost everyone has an account on these platforms.


CONSEQUENCES:
User must have a Google, Facebook or GitHub account.
