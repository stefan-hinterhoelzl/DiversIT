TITLE:
ADR001 - Choice of Frontend Framework


STATUS:
Accepted


CONTEXT:
For this project the team needs to settle on one frontend framework. Several frameworks would make sense for a project at this scale. 
Angular, React and Vue would be the favourites due to their importance in our future workplaces. 
All offer similar pros and cons with the main difference of the learning curve. Angular is more strict and requires developers
to be more structured, whereas Vue is very easy to get into but not as organized. React lies in the middle of these two extremes. 


DECISION:
The team decided on using Angular. 


CONSEQUENCES:
Based on existing knowledge in some teammembers the decision was made to go for angular. It might have the hardest learning curve, 
but is also the most powerfull framework. Our aim is to distribut the existing knowledge in the team and help each other to overcome 
entry barriers. We expect to have a slow start to set everything up, but think, that the organized structure of an angular project will
save us time down the line.
