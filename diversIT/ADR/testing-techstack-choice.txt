TITLE:
ADR006 - Choice of testing techstack


STATUS:
Accepted


CONTEXT:
For this project the team needs to settle on a techsteck for automated testing. Several testing frameworks and test runners are available,
for would make sense for a project that is mainly implemented in Angular.
For automated tests on unit, integration and end-to-end level, for example frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine with Karma, Cypress and 
Puppeteer are available.

For end-to-end UI tests, previous versions of Angular came with the framework Protractor already included, when using Angular CLI.
For latest Angular versions, this is no longer the case. Protractor is now deprecated and a more modern alternative is Cypress.


DECISION:
For Angular, Jasmine is the recommended testing framework for unit tests. Angular CLI comes by default with Jasmine and Karma as the test runner.
Even though e.g. Jest, which was developed for React, would also be a valid option with some advantages, the team did not see a big enough reason 
that would justify deviating from the recommended standard. Jasmine and Karma also work very well together.

For end-to-end UI tests, the team decided to follow Angulars recommendation to replace the deprecated Protractor framework with Cypress.


CONSEQUENCES:
None expected, except lock-in of having to transfer existing tests in case a switch do a different tech stack would be necessary.
In general, moving from Jasmine to Jest is considered to be relatively straightforward.
